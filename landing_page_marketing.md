# VolleyRef.App — Landing Page Marketing Brief

A living document of product positioning, user pain points, and messaging direction. Use this as the source of truth when generating or revising landing page copy.

---

## Core Positioning

- **"An assistant ref in your pocket."** — The app is a rules-compliant second brain for the referee. It doesn't replace the ref, it backs them up.
- The real value isn't "no more paper" — it's **stress relief**. The app handles the complex rule enforcement so the ref can focus on the match.
- The ref is "the sheriff in the wild west with everyone complaining to him." Coaches challenge, players argue, and the rules don't get simpler. The app is the deputy that never makes a mistake.

---

## Target Audience

1. **Referees** — Primary. Under constant pressure to enforce complex rules correctly. One mistake and everyone notices.
2. **Tournament Organizers** — Score multiple matches back-to-back. Need clean scoresheets at the end of the day.
3. **Coaches** — Review match history, track lineup decisions, keep records.

## Pain Points (What Keeps Refs Up at Night)

### Rule enforcement under pressure
- **Missed rotations** — A rotation error slips by until the other coach spots it. Now you're replaying points and losing credibility.
- **Illegal substitutions** — Sub limits, positional restrictions, libero replacements — tracking it all manually under pressure is where mistakes happen.
- **Libero violations** — Libero didn't wait a rally to return, wrong positional entry, re-designation mid-match. These are constant edge cases.
- **Exceptional substitutions** — When a player is injured or disqualified, the replacement rules are different and easy to get wrong.
- **Disqualifications** — DQ triggers exceptional sub rules that are complex and rarely practiced.
- **Multiple substitutions** — Several subs happening at once, tracking which player replaced whom, enforcing limits per set.

### The paper scoresheet
- **FIVB scoresheets are non-obvious** — If you haven't been specifically trained, it's easy to fill them in wrong.
- One wrong column, one missed entry, and you're handing in a sheet full of corrections.
- Post-match paperwork is tedious and error-prone — the app generates it automatically.

### General pressure
- Coaches challenge every call. When you're enforcing complex rules by hand, you're always one mistake away from chaos.
- The rules don't get simpler over time — they get more complex.

## Hero Copy Direction

### Variant A (winner so far)
- **Headline:** "An Assistant Ref / In Your Pocket."
- **Subline:** "Missed rotation? Impossible. Illegal sub? Blocked. Libero violation? Caught."

### Variant B
- **Headline:** "Every Rule. / Every Time."
- **Subline:** Same as above.

### What NOT to lead with
- "Zero paper" / "No more paper" — This is a nice benefit but not the core value. The real pain is rule enforcement under pressure, not paper elimination.
- "Professional scorekeeping" — Too generic, doesn't speak to the ref's actual stress.

---

## Pricing

- **First set free** (not "first match free"). No credit card required.
- Weekly: $4.99 — Best for single tournaments
- Monthly: $14.99 — Best for league season
- Yearly: $49.99 — Best for year-round officiating (save $130/yr vs weekly)

---

## Design Direction

- Dark theme, warm sport palette (orange `#f97316` / red `#ef4444`), not blue/purple.
- iOS 26 Liquid Glass aesthetic — `backdrop-filter: blur(40px) saturate(180%)`, glass cards, gradient borders.
- Film grain texture overlay for visual interest.
- The blue/purple color scheme was rejected as "boring."
- **NO EMOJIS.** Emojis look cheap. Use inline SVG stroke icons instead.
- Floating glass pill navbar.
- Section labels with orange accent lines.
- Problem cards with red left border accent.

---

## Tone of Voice

- Direct and confident, not salesy or corporate.
- Speak to the ref's lived experience — they know the pressure, don't explain it to them.
- Short punchy sentences. Not wordy paragraphs.
- "Missed rotation? Impossible." not "Our app helps prevent rotation errors."
