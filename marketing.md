# VolleyRef Marketing Notes

## Primary Go-To-Market Offer: Free Weekend (Tournament Organizer)

### Offer (simple)
"Pick one court for your next tournament weekend. I’ll set up VolleyRef for free. You get live scoreboard links and clean exported scoresheets. If it helps, keep using it."

### Why it works
- Low risk for them (free, one court, one weekend)
- High upside for us (real-world proof + testimonial + expansion to more courts)

### Outreach script (copy/paste)
**Subject:** Free scorekeeping + live scoreboard for one court this weekend?

**Body:**
Hey [Name] - I’m building VolleyRef, a volleyball scorekeeper that enforces rules (subs, rotations, libero, sanctions) and shares a live scoreboard link.

If you have an event coming up, I’ll set it up for one court for free for the weekend. You’ll get clean exported scoresheets after each match.

If it’s useful, we can expand to more courts. If not, no worries.

Want me to send a 30-second demo and get you set up?

### Notes
- Keep it time-boxed: 1 court, 1 weekend.
- Emphasize outcomes: less chaos, live scoreboard, clean scoresheets.
- Ask for a testimonial if it goes well.

## Offer: Charity Tournament Weekend + 7-Day Pass for Participants

### Offer (simple)
"For your charity tournament weekend, VolleyRef is free. Every referee/scorekeeper who uses it gets a 7-day pass afterward."

### Why it works
- Organizer gets a clear upgrade for the event (free)
- Refs learn it in a real environment
- The 7-day pass creates a natural next-step: use it again the following week

### Guardrails (so it doesn’t get abused)
- Distribution control: use a simple claim flow (QR per court, or codes handed to ref crews). Avoid one global code that can spread.
- Define the pass: 7 days starts when claimed, and limit to one claim per device/email.

### Implementation idea (low-friction)
- Print a one-page sheet per court with:
  - QR: "Claim your 7-day pass"
  - Short URL fallback
  - One-line instructions
- After the event, email the organizer a template message they can send to refs: "Thanks. Here’s your 7-day pass link."

### Pitch (copy/paste)
"If you’re running a charity tournament, I’d love to sponsor the scorekeeping. VolleyRef is free for the weekend, and every referee who uses it gets a 7-day pass afterward so they can use it for their next matches. I’ll help you set up one court first, and scale it if you like it."
