# VolleyRef Marketing Notes

## Primary Go-To-Market Offer: Free Weekend (Tournament Organizer)

### Offer (simple)
"Pick one court for your next tournament weekend. I’ll set up VolleyRef for free. You get live scoreboard links and clean exported scoresheets. If it helps, keep using it."

### Why it works
- Low risk for them (free, one court, one weekend)
- High upside for us (real-world proof + testimonial + expansion to more courts)

### Outreach script (copy/paste)
**Subject:** Free scorekeeping + live scoreboard for one court this weekend?

**Body:**
Hey [Name] - I’m building VolleyRef, a volleyball scorekeeper that enforces rules (subs, rotations, libero, sanctions) and shares a live scoreboard link.

If you have an event coming up, I’ll set it up for one court for free for the weekend. You’ll get clean exported scoresheets after each match.

If it’s useful, we can expand to more courts. If not, no worries.

Want me to send a 30-second demo and get you set up?

### Notes
- Keep it time-boxed: 1 court, 1 weekend.
- Emphasize outcomes: less chaos, live scoreboard, clean scoresheets.
- Ask for a testimonial if it goes well.
